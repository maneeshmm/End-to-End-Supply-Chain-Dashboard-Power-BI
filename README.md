# End to End Supply Chain Dashboard Power BI

## 1. Introduction
The "End to End Supply Chain Dashboard" project aims to provide a comprehensive visualization of supply chain operations using Power BI. This dashboard enables businesses to monitor key metrics related to procurement, inventory, manufacturing, logistics, and supplier performance, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

## 2. Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into supply chain performance, including:

Supplier performance evaluation

Inventory and stock level tracking

Order and sales analysis

Logistics and transportation monitoring

Cost and revenue analysis

## 3. Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project contains 100 records and 24 attributes covering various aspects of supply chain management, including:

Product Details: SKU, Product Type, Price, Availability, Stock Levels

Sales & Revenue: Number of Products Sold, Revenue Generated

Supplier Information: Supplier Name, Location, Lead Time

Manufacturing Data: Production Volumes, Manufacturing Lead Time, Manufacturing Costs, Inspection Results, Defect Rates

Logistics & Shipping: Order Quantities, Shipping Times, Shipping Carriers, Transportation Modes, Routes, Costs

## 4. Data Preparation & Transformation
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor in Power BI:

Missing values were handled appropriately.

Data types were formatted for consistency.

Relationships between tables were created for effective visualization.

Calculated columns and measures were added for better insights (e.g., total revenue, average lead time, defect rate percentage).

## 5. Dashboard Features & Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes the following key components:

Supplier Performance Analysis: Lead times, defect rates, inspection results

Inventory Management: Stock levels, availability trends, reorder analysis

Sales & Revenue Insights: Total revenue, top-performing products, order quantities

Logistics Performance: Shipping costs, transportation modes, delivery lead times

Manufacturing Efficiency: Production volumes, defect rates, manufacturing lead times

## 6. Business Insights & Findings

High Defect Rates: Some suppliers have significantly high defect rates, impacting product quality.

Shipping Costs Variation: Transportation costs vary depending on the carrier and route used.

Stock Levels Optimization: Certain products frequently run out of stock, indicating the need for better inventory forecasting.

Supplier Efficiency: Lead times for different suppliers vary, affecting overall supply chain performance.

## 7. Conclusion & Recommendations
The "End to End Supply Chain Dashboard" provides valuable insights for optimizing supply chain operations. Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

Partner with suppliers that have lower defect rates and faster lead times.

Optimize transportation routes to reduce shipping costs.

Improve inventory management by implementing predictive analytics for stock replenishment.

Enhance quality control mechanisms to minimize defects in manufacturing.

## 8. Future Scope
Future enhancements for the dashboard may include:

Integration with real-time supply chain data sources

Advanced forecasting models using AI/ML for demand prediction

Automated alerts and notifications for critical supply chain events

This Power BI project successfully demonstrates the power of data visualization in supply chain management, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.
